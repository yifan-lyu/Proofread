abstract = {Objective-This report presents 2019 total fertility rates for the United States, by educational attainment and race and Hispanic origin of mother. Methods-Descriptive tabulations of the total fertility rate by educational attainment of mother for the United States are presented and described. The total fertility rate is the average number of children a group of women would expect to have at the end of their reproductive lifetimes. Data are based on the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. Results-In 2019, the U.S. total fertility rate (TFR) for all women aged 15-49 was 1,705 expected births per 1,000 women. TFRs decreased as level of education increased from women with a 12th grade education or less through an associate's and bachelor's degree, and then rose from bachelor's degree through a doctorate or professional degree. Among the race and Hispanic-origin groups, TFRs were highest for Hispanic women (1,939), followed by non-Hispanic black (1,774) and non-Hispanic white (1,610) women. Rates generally declined from the lowest educational level through a bachelor's degree for non-Hispanic white women, and through an associate's degree for Hispanic women, and then generally rose for both groups for women with advanced degrees. TFRs for non-Hispanic black women declined by educational level through a master's degree. Across the race and Hispanic-origin groups, the lowest TFR by educational level was for non-Hispanic black women with a master's degree (1,038), and the highest was for Hispanic women with a 12th grade education or less (3,025). TFRs for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women with some college credit or less were generally higher than the rates for non-Hispanic white women, but TFRs for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women with a master's degree or more were generally lower than the rates for non-Hispanic white women.},

When children are modeled as consumption commitments, increases in earnings risk are associated with a reduction in family sizes and patterns of delayed childbearing. Since household ability to bear children declines with age, the postponement of birth associated with the increased earnings risk drives down the number of birth per family further. An access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) is shown to have only a limited offsetting effect.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the issues of whether reductions in fertility increase human capital investments per child and whether twinning can identify the quantity-quality (Q-Q) trade-off. We show that estimates of the effects of twinning at higher parities on the outcomes of older children in prior studies do not identify family-size effects but are confounded by inter-child allocation effects because of the endowment deficit and close spacing of twins. However, examining the effects of twinning by birth order, net of the effects stemming from the endowment deficit of twins, can provide upper and lower bounds on the trade-off between the family size and average child quality. Our estimates, based on data from China, indicate that an extra child at parity one or at parity two, net of one component of birth-endowment effects associated with birth weight, significantly decreases the schooling progress, the expected college enrolment, grades in school and the assessed health of all children in the family. Despite the evident significant trade-off between number of children and child quality in China, the findings suggest that the contribution of the one-child policy in China to the development of its human capital was modest. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

It summarizes the evidence from diverse literatures on the importance of early life conditions in shaping multiple life skills and the evidence on critical and sensitive investment periods for shaping different skills. It presents economic models that rationalize the evidence and unify the treatment effect and family influence literatures. The evidence on the empirical and policy importance of credit constraints in forming skills is examined. There is little support for the claim that untargeted income transfer policies to poor families significantly boost child outcomes. Mentoring, parenting, and attachment are essential features of successful families and interventions that shape skills at all stages of childhood. The next wave of family studies will better capture the active role of the emerging autonomous child in learning and responding to the actions of parents, mentors, and teachers. {\textcopyright} 2014 by Annual Reviews.

We further develop the model and find that a policy-induced welfare loss originates from not only restricted fertility but also from marriage distortion, and both depend solely on the corresponding reduced-form elasticities. Our calculations suggest that the total welfare loss is around 4.9 percent of yearly household income, with marriage distortion contributing 17 percent of this welfare loss. These findings highlight the importance of taking into consideration the unintended behavioral responses to public policies and the corresponding social consequences.},

abstract = {The extent to which China's family planning policy has driven its fertility transition over the past decades is debatable. The disagreement is partly sourced from the different ways of measuring the policy. Most existing measures, constructed on the policy history, generally, do not include complete secular and cross-sectional policy variations, fail to heterogeneously reflect people's exposure to the policy, and often suffer from endogeneity. This paper reviews the entire history of China's family planning policy and accordingly, proposes a new policy measure that integrates the policy variations more completely, heterogeneously, and exogenously by using the cross-sectional data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The new measure estimates the effect of policy on fertility and generates negative regression coefficients that well reproduce the history. As for the contribution of the policy to fertility transition, the measure explains a sizable level shift of fertility for major cohorts, but only accounts for a small portion of the fertility decline over generations. In addition, a more-educated woman, a woman residing in a better-developed coastal province, or a woman whose first child is a son tends to desire fewer children and thus, receives lighter pressure from the policy. Other than fertility, a woman would delay her marriage in response to the policy, particularly when it is strongly enforced. Finally, the paper shows that using an incomplete measure could systematically underestimate the effect of policy on fertility and adopting an endogenous measure or a measure lacking heterogeneity could even produce a positive effect of the policy.},

abstract = {Scholarly evidence on the quantity-quality trade-off is mixed in part because of the identification challenge due to endogenous family size. This paper provides new evidence of the causal effect of child quantity on child quality by exploiting regional differences in the enforcement intensity of China's one-child policy (OCP) as an exogenous source of variation in family size. Using the percentage of current mothers of primary childbearing age who gave a higher order birth in 1981, we construct a quantitative indicator of the extent of local violation of the OCP, referred to as the excess fertility rate (EFR). We then use regional differences in EFRs, net differences in pre-existing fertility preferences and socio-economic characteristics, to proxy for regional differences in OCP enforcement intensity. Using micro data from the Chinese Population Censuses, we find that prefectures with stricter enforcement of the OCP have experienced larger declines in family size and also greater improvements in children's education. Despite the evident trade-off between family size and child quality in China, our quantitative estimates suggest that China's OCP makes only a modest contribution to the development of its human capital.},

Poor Chinese families, whose fertility choices are less constrained by the OCP than rich ones, have more children but invest less in human capital per child. Since human capital is a major determinant of earnings, the income inequality persists and enlarges across generations as a consequence.

OCP accounts for 32.7%-47.3% of the decline in intergenerational income mobility. The OCP has significant ramifications for Chinese society, not only intragenerationally but also intergenerationally.},

Output is determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of nonlinear factor models. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle for the production of cognitive skills. It increases in later stages of the life cycle for the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For some configurations of disadvantage and outcomes, it is optimal to invest relatively more in the later stages of childhood.},

abstract = {In this paper, I study how rural-to-urban migration in China affects households' inter-generational behavior, and the effects of policies targeting migrant households on their welfare. Internal migration from rural to urban areas can have significant welfare effects on migrants and their extended families. In China, migration is often temporary, and most family members of migrant workers are left behind. In these households, many left-behind grandparents look after the children of migrating parents. However , the behavioral and welfare effects of government policies directed towards rural households with potential migrants remain unknown. Using five Chinese data sets on the migration patterns, education choices, financial transfers, and health of multi-generational families, I first present a rich set of stylized facts about migration and household behavior. The evidence shows that in many rural households, parents migrate to urban areas for work when healthy grandparents are able to provide childcare. When the grandparents are sick, migrating parents return to the rural area to provide elder care and pay for their parents' healthcare. With the facts as a guide, I develop and estimate a structural model of the behavior of migrants and their families. The model features an informal limited-commitment contract over child care, financial transfers, and elder care. Parents and grandparents play a sequential game by choosing migration status, informal contract status, remittances, children's education, and grandparents' healthcare. The estimates suggest that poor households adopt the informal contract so that rural consumption, education, and healthcare are funded by the migrants' remittance. I then use the model to evaluate the effects of a set of hypothetical government policies. An urban education subsidy promotes children's education, increases the migrants' consumption in the urban area, and does not affect the grandparents' welfare. But it does not alleviate the problem of children left behind as the government had hoped. An improved insurance coverage that lowers out-of-pocket healthcare costs would reduce the grandparents' demand for the informal contract. It would generate a welfare gain to the grandparents, discourage parents' migration, and increase children's education. The policy counterfactual outcomes imply that policies intended to improve the welfare of one family member can affect the welfare, consumption behavior and migration decisions of all three generations through intra-household cooperation. The design of these policies should account for intra-household responses.},

abstract = {The quantity–quality tradeoff theory implies that a reduction in fertility would induce more human capital investment per child, and it is widely believed that population control policy could promote human capital levels in developing countries. China's one-child policy (OCP) has significantly reduced the fertility in the country, and popular belief holds that this policy has contributed to the enhancement in China's human capital since 1979. However, the quantity–quality tradeoff dose not present the complete truth—another crucial factor relates to which segment of the population is reduced, a critical issue that has been ignored in the literature. China's OCP is significantly more strictly implemented in urban areas than in rural areas, where human capital investment in children is significantly lower. This two-tier OCP could have significantly increased the rural–urban fertility ratio and brought about important consequences. We first emphasize the importance of such a population compositional effect, which may offset the potentially positive quantity–quality tradeoff effect on human capital. We present a simple analytic framework and quantify the relative sizes of the quantity–quality tradeoff and compositional effects. We find that the former is dominated by the latter, and that the OCP has reduced the average human capital level of China's next generation by approximately 1–2%. This novel evidence indicates that the conventional wisdom on population control may be incomplete and that its policy implications could be misleading.},

Parents do not receive fewer financial support as a consequence, but they have fewer children living close by and receive fewer contacts and visits from children.

We provide empirical evidence for the following findings: (1) Stricter implementation of the one-child policy leads to more child abandonment locally and more child abduction in neighboring regions; (2) A stronger son-preference bias intensifies both the local effects and spatial spillover effects of the region's one-child policy on child abandonment and abduction; and, (3) With the gradual relaxation of the one-child policy after 2002, the frequency of both child abandonment and child abduction has decreased significantly.

First, it provides a new theory of wealth inequality that merges two empirically relevant forces generating inequality: bequest motives and inheritance of ability across generations; and an earnings process that allows for more earnings risk for the richest. Second, it uses the resulting calibrated framework to study the effects of changing estate taxation. Increasing the estate tax reduces the wealth concentration in the hands of the richest few and the economic advantage of being born to a rich and super-rich family at the cost of reduced aggregate capital and output. However, all of these effects are quite small. In contrast, increasing estate taxation can generate a significant welfare gain to a newborn under the veil of ignorance, but this comes at a large welfare cost for the super-rich.},

However, examining the effects of twinning by birth order, net of the effects stemming from the endowment deficit of twins, can provide upper and lower bounds on the trade-off between the family size and average child quality. Our estimates, based on data from China, indicate that an extra child at parity one or at parity two, net of one component of birth-endowment effects associated with birth weight, significantly decreases the schooling progress, the expected college enrolment, grades in school and the assessed health of all children in the family.

abstract = {Using micro-data from 48 developing countries, this article studies changes in cross-sectional patterns of fertility and child investment over the demographic transition. Before 1960, children from larger families obtained more education, in large part because they had richer and more educated parents. By century's end, these patterns had reversed. Consequently, fertility differentials by income and education historically raised the average education of the next generation, but they now reduce it. Relative to the level of average education, the positive effect of differential fertility in the past exceeded its negative effect in the present. While the reversal of differential fertility is unrelated to changes in GDP per capita, women's work, sectoral composition, or health, roughly half is attributable to rising aggregate education in the parents' generation. The data are consistent with a model in which fertility has a hump-shaped relationship with parental skill, due to a corner solution in which low-skill parents forgo investment in their children.As the returns to child investment rise, the peak of the relationship shifts to the left, reversing the associations under study.},

The solution method we develop for structural estimation extends the endogenous grid-point method (EGM) to discrete-continuous (DC) problems. Discrete choices can lead to kinks in the value functions and discontinuities in the optimal policy rules, greatly complicating the solution of the model. We show how these problems are ameliorated in the presence of additive choice-specific independent and identically distributed extreme value taste shocks that are typically interpreted as “unobserved state variables” in structural econometric applications, or serve as “random noise” to smooth out kinks in the value functions in numerical applications. We present Monte Carlo experiments that demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the DC-EGM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood estimator for structural estimation of a life-cycle model of consumption with discrete retirement decisions.</p>},

abstract = {China initiated its family planning policy in 1962 and its one-child policy in 1980, and it allowed all couples to have two children as of 1 January 2016. This paper systematically examines the labor market consequences of China's family planning policies. First, we briefly review the historical evolution of China's family planning policies and the existing literature. Second, we investigate the effects of these policies on the labor market, focusing on the size and quality of the working-age population and its age and gender composition. We give special attention to regional differences in the demographic structure resulting from the interaction of the family planning policies and internal migration. Finally, we discuss ongoing and prospective policy changes and their potential consequences. Although urban areas and coastal provinces have implemented stricter family planning policies, our analysis shows that because of internal migration, the aging problem is more severe in rural areas and in inland provinces. Our simulation results further indicate that the new two-child policy might fall short of pulling China out of its aging situation.},

The model, estimated to the US in the 2000s, implies that a counterfactual flat income-fertility profile would—through the equalization of initial conditions—increase intergenerational mobility by 6%.

Further consequences include lower rates of residing with the elderly and higher household income, consumption, and savings. Finally, exposure to stricter fertility restrictions in early life increases female empowerment.

Our estimation shows that there exist both large migration costs and a large underlying productivity difference between rural agricultural and urban non-agricultural sectors in China. More than half of the observed labor earnings gap between the two sectors can be attributed to the underlying productivity difference, and less than half of the gap can be attributed to sorting of workers. We also structurally estimate a general equilibrium Roy model and use it to quantify the effects of reducing migration costs on the observed sectoral productivity difference, migration, and aggregate productivity. If we implement a hukou policy reform by setting the hukou liberalization index in all regions of China to the level of the most liberal region, the observed agricultural productivity gap would decrease by more than 30%, the migrant share would increase by about 9%, and the aggregate productivity would increase by 1.1%. In contrast, in a partial equilibrium in which the underlying productivity difference does not change with migration cost, the hukou policy reform would reduce the observed agricultural productivity gap by only 9%, the migrant share would increase by more than 50%, and the aggregate productivity would increase by 6.8%.},

Using a calibrated general-equilibrium model, a benchmark with a fertility constraint in place is compared to a counterfactual experiment without the fertility constraint. The results indicate that the implementation of the one-child policy promotes the accumulation of human capital and increases per capita output. In addition, the policy leads to different welfare effects across generations and skill groups. The initial generation would benefit from relaxing the one-child policy, but the following generations would be hurt. A redistribution effect between skilled and unskilled workers is also observed. These findings demonstrate that focusing solely on GDP per capita as a measure of economic well-being paints an incomplete picture of the welfare consequences of population policies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We develop an overlapping generations model in which fertility decisions and capital accumulation are endogenously determined in the presence of social security. In our model, children are an alternative savings technology-as they transfer resources to their retired parents. Important feedback links arise between fertility and social security variables: an expansion of social security benefits reduces fertility-partially offsetting the effects of relaxing the one-child policy. The feedback loop between social security variables and fertility suggests that abandoning fertility restrictions may not be as effective in helping to finance China's intended pension reform, especially if children are an important source of old-age support. The sustainability of the pension system is particularly at risk in the event of a growth slowdown. The objective of pension reforms may also be incongruent with other reforms, such as financial liberalization and financial integration.},

We then instrument family size by the exogenous variation that is induced by a twin birth and find a negative effect of family size on children's education. We also find that the effect of family size is more evident in rural China, where the public education system is poor. Given that our estimates of the effect of having twins on nontwins at least provide the lower bound of the true effect of family size, these findings suggest a quantity-quality trade-off for children in developing countries.},

Using a dataset with 2,096,798 child- parent(s) pairs combined from various rounds of ten separate national household surveys, we leverage exogenous variation in fine rates imposed for One-Child Policy violations across provinces to study causal impacts of the One-Child Policy on intergenerational persistence. Using a continuous difference-in-differences approach, we find that for cohorts born between 1980 and 1996, the One-Child Policy reduced persistence in intergenerational income, education, and social class, comparing to those born prior to 1979. We estimate that the overall effect of the One-Child Policy fines was to reduce persistence in intergenerational income, education, and social class by 28.1%, 48.7%, and 24.8%, respectively. Analyzing mechanisms, we find that the One-Child Policy boosted China's intergenerational mobility by diminishing elite family heirship, concentrating resources for lower-income families, and decreasing returns to education.

abstract = {BACKGROUND China introduced its world-famous One-Child Policy in 1979. However, its fertility appears to have declined even faster in the early 1970s than it did after 1979. The fertility rate declined by three children, from 5.7 in 1969 to 2.7 in 1978. OBJECTIVE What accounts for such a rapid decline in fertility rate during the 1970s? In this study, we highlight the importance of the Family Planning Leading Group (FPLG) in understanding China's fertility decline since the early 1970s. METHODS From 1969 to 1975, provinces gradually established agencies of the FPLG to implement family planning policies. We construct a difference-in-difference (DID) model to estimate the policy effect by exploiting the provincial variation in establishment years. We also develop a measure of policy exposure based on the province and the mother's birth cohort that is applicable to many publicly available household-level data. CONCLUSIONS Our DID model explains about half of China's total fertility rate decline from 5.7 in 1969 to 2.7 in 1978. Additionally, despite its simple construction, our proposed policy measure aptly explains China's rapid decline in family sizes. CONTRIBUTION We provide simple and practical approaches that characterize the causal effect of China's family planning policies during the early 1970s. Our approaches can be easily implemented on province-year panel data and typical household surveys.},

Important feedback links arise between fertility and social security variables: an expansion of social security benefits reduces fertility-partially offsetting the effects of relaxing the one-child policy. The feedback loop between social security variables and fertility suggests that abandoning fertility restrictions may not be as effective in helping to finance China's intended pension reform, especially if children are an important source of old-age support. The sustainability of the pension system is particularly at risk in the event of a growth slowdown. The objective of pension reforms may also be incongruent with other reforms, such as financial liberalization and financial integration.},

This paper presents an analysis of China's census data that indicates that the "missing girls" phenomenon is causally linked to enforcement of the One Child Policy. Fertility is lower and sex ratios are higher among those under stricter fertility control, and the overall increase in the sex ratio is driven by an increase in the prevalence of sex selection among first and second births. By exploiting regional and temporal variation in fines levied for unauthorized births, I find that higher fine regimes discourage fertility, but are associated with higher ratios of males to females. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.},

abstract = {In this chapter we revisit the relationship between income and fertility. There is overwhelming empirical evidence that fertility is negatively related to income in most countries at most times. Several theories have been proposed in the literature to explain this somewhat puzzling fact. The most common one is based on the opportunity cost of time being higher for individuals with higher earnings. Alternatively, people might differ in their desire to procreate and accordingly some people invest more in children and less in market-specific human capital and thus have lower earnings. We revisit these and other possible explanations. We find that these theories are not as robust as is commonly believed. That is, several special assumptions are needed to generate the negative relationship. Not all assumptions are equally plausible. Such findings will be useful to distinguish alternative theories. We conclude that further research along these lines is needed.},

As these societies have been influenced by Confucianism over millennia, marriage and fertility decisions are potentially shaped by two social norms: the unequal gender division of childcare and the stigma attached to out-of-wedlock births. We present a model incorporating the two social norms, and structurally estimate it using data from South Korea. We find that the social norm of unequal gender division of childcare plays a significant role in the low fertility rates, especially for highly educated women. However, the social stigma attached to out-of-wedlock births has modest effects on the childlessness rate for single women. Our results show that the tension between the persistent gender ideology and the rapid socioeconomic development is the main driving force behind the unique marriage and fertility patterns in East Asian societies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND China introduced its world-famous One-Child Policy in 1979. However, its fertility appears to have declined even faster in the early 1970s than it did after 1979. The fertility rate declined by three children, from 5.7 in 1969 to 2.7 in 1978. OBJECTIVE What accounts for such a rapid decline in fertility rate during the 1970s? In this study, we highlight the importance of the Family Planning Leading Group (FPLG) in understanding China's fertility decline since the early 1970s. METHODS From 1969 to 1975, provinces gradually established agencies of the FPLG to implement family planning policies. We construct a difference-in-difference (DID) model to estimate the policy effect by exploiting the provincial variation in establishment years. We also develop a measure of policy exposure based on the province and the mother's birth cohort that is applicable to many publicly available household-level data. CONCLUSIONS Our DID model explains about half of China's total fertility rate decline from 5.7 in 1969 to 2.7 in 1978. Additionally, despite its simple construction, our proposed policy measure aptly explains China's rapid decline in family sizes. CONTRIBUTION We provide simple and practical approaches that characterize the causal effect of China's family planning policies during the early 1970s. Our approaches can be easily implemented on province-year panel data and typical household surveys.},

abstract = {In this paper I analyze the determinants of cohabitation, marriage, and divorce in the US. I first document that college graduates are more likely to marry, and less likely to cohabit and divorce, than non-college educated individuals. To account for these facts within a unified framework, I build and estimate a life-cycle model of partnership formation and dissolution where income processes differ by gender and education. I find that the main driver of education-based differences in mating strategies is that the gender wage gap is larger among college graduates. Since divorce is more costly than ending a cohabitation, marriages tend to be more stable and therefore offer women more protection from human capital depreciation during nonemployment. Consequently, marriage is a more effective means of enforcing household specialization. Since college graduates have more room for household specialization, they are more likely to choose marriage. The variance of income shocks, which affects the demand for consumption insurance, is larger among college graduates. Even if the variance of income shocks could potentially explain partnership choices, simulations suggest a small role of income volatility.},

To what extent are these provisions holding back the female labour supply? We estimate a rich dynamic life-cycle model of labour supply and savings for couples and singles using the Method of Simulated Moments for the 1945 and 1955 birth cohorts. Our model matches well the life-cycle profiles of labour market participation, hours, and savings for married and single people, and generates plausible elasticities of labour supply. It implies that eliminating these marriage-related provisions would drastically increase the participation of married women over their entire life cycle, reduce the participation of married men after age 60, and increase savings. If the resulting government surplus were used to lower income taxation, there would be large welfare gains for the vast majority of the population. These results hold for both cohorts, including the later one, which has participation similar to that of more recent generations.},

This framework also allows the inverse problem of computing the vector of aggregate marriages given a new distribution of available single individuals and estimated preferences to be solved. The solution to this inverse problem has been shown to exist under mild conditions. This paper also develops a simple test of the model's empirical validity.

A simulation of the model using Census fertility and income data shows that it can predict the recent transition to more assortative matching as the skill premium has increased, assisted reproduction technologies have emerged, and desired family sizes have fallen.},

abstract = {This paper considers how divorce law alters the incentives for couples to invest in their marriage, focusing on the impact of unilateral divorce laws on investments in new marriages. Differences across states between 1970 and 1980 provide useful quasi-experimental variation with which to consider incentives to invest in several types of marriage-specific capital: spouse's education, children, household specialization, and home ownership. I find that adoption of unilateral divorce - regardless of the prevailing property-division laws - reduces investment in all types of marriage-specific capital considered except home ownership. In contrast, results for home ownership depend on the underlying property division laws.},
